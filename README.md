Hi there, 
I'm Natalia and I am genuinely interested in becoming a Front-End Developer.
I am a graduate of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań in Medical Physics. <br> I am a person who has always loved science, solving puzzles and searching out of the box solutions. My friend instilled programming in me 4 years ago. It was just a hobby back then, but it evolved into something more and I decided to develop in this field. At the moment, most of my attention is focused on learning new technologies, such as JavaScript, jQuery, React, hoping that will allow me to work as a Junior Front-End Developer.
